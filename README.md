# cpp-queue-stack-implementation
Just another cpp implementation

To use this library you need to create a main.cpp file and must include "container/container.hpp" and the data struct you'd like to use, for example queue vector "queue/queue.hpp" and "queue/vec/queuevec.hpp"
After that just type: "using namespace lasd"
